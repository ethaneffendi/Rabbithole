# Dev Log - 2025-08-04: Code Refactor and UI Improvements

## Summary

This log details a series of refactorings and UI enhancements aimed at improving code quality, performance, and user experience.

## Backend Refactor (`backend.js`)

- **Code Cleanup:** Removed distracting comments and commented-out code that was no longer in use.
- **`TabEventProcessor`:** Refactored the class to be more efficient. The `enqueue` method was simplified, and the `processNext` method was streamlined for better readability and performance.
- **Event Listeners:** Simplified the `onUpdated` listener to remove redundant storage calls.

## UI Improvements

- **Graph Updates (`popup.js`):**
  - The `updateGraphData` function was significantly improved to perform differential updates. Instead of rebuilding the entire graph on every change, it now intelligently adds or removes only the necessary nodes and edges, resulting in a much smoother and more performant graph.
  - A helper function, `getLabelFromUrl`, was created to centralize the logic for generating node labels from URLs.

- **User Feedback (`button.js`, `hello.html`, `mystyle.css`):**
  - Replaced the disruptive `alert()` notifications for saving and loading graphs with a non-intrusive status message that appears and fades out.
  - Added a new `<span>` element to `hello.html` to display these messages.
  - Added CSS styles in `mystyle.css` to position and style the status message.

## Task Management

- **`toDoList.md`:** Updated the task log to reflect the completion of the backend and UI refactoring tasks.
