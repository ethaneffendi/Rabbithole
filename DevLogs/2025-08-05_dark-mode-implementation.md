# Dev Log - 2025-08-05: Dark Mode Implementation

## Feature Update

### Dark Mode for UI

- **Implemented a "dark mode" for the user interface.** This feature enhances user experience by providing a low-light alternative that reduces eye strain, especially in dark environments.
- **Added a toggle switch on the options page** to allow users to easily enable or disable dark mode.
- **The user's preference for dark mode is saved** to `chrome.storage`, so it persists across browser sessions.
- **The implementation involved:**
    - Adding a toggle switch to `options.html`.
    - Creating new CSS styles in `mystyle.css` for the dark mode theme.
    - Adding JavaScript logic to `options.js` to handle theme switching and saving the user's preference.
