HELLO!
BACKEND DO EVERYTHING FOR YOU
AS LONG AS YOUR MANIFEST CONTAINS
"
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "backend.js"
  },
  "permissions": [
    "tabs",
    "storage",
    "scripting",
    "webNavigation"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "<all_urls>"
  ]
"
THEN IT WILL WORK ADN DO EVERYTHING
IN ORDER TO GET THE GRAPH DATA SIMPLY USE
(await chrome.storage.local.get(['graphData'])).graphData
AND YOU WILL GET IT IN OBJECT FORM

!!!!!IMPORTANT THAT IT'S IN OBJECT FORM!!!!!
IT'S MORE SIMILAR TO PYTHON DICTS THAN JAVASCRIPT MAPS
AS INSTEAD OF .GET AND .SET
YOU USE name['thing'] TO GET A REFERENCE (MEANING YOU DO IT TO SET IT TOO)

THERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF CREATE GRAPH THAT'S AT THE END OF BACKEND.JS
HOWEVER IT MIGHT NOT WORK, AND I DO NOT HAVE THE LIBRARY TO USE IT
GOOD LUCK!
ASK ME IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS
